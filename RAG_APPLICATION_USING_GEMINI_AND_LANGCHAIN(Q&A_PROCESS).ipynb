The city, founded in the year 1591 by Mohammed Quli Qutub Shah, the  \\nfifth sultan of Qutb Shahi dynasty, offers a fascinating panorama of the past, with richly  \\nmixed cultural and historical tradition spanning over 400 years. It is one of the fastest  \\ngrowing cities of India and has emerged as a strong industrial, commercial, technology  \\ncenter, gives a picture of glimpses of past splenders and the legacy of its old hist ory.The \\nhistory of Hyderabad begins with the establishment of the Qutb Shahi dynasty. Quli Qutb  \\nShah seized the reins of power from the Bahamani kingdom in 1512 and established the  \\nfortress city of Golconda. Inadequacy of water, and frequent epidemics of p lague and  \\ncholera persuaded Mohammed Quli Qutub Shah to venture outward to establish new city  \\nwith the Charminar at its centre and with four great roads fanning out four cardinal  \\ndirections. Hyderabad's fame, strategic location and Golconda's legendary wealth \\nattracted Aurangazeb who captured Golconda after a long seize in 1687. \\n \\nAfter this defeat the importance of Hyderabad declined and the city fell into partial  \\nruins. As the Moghul empire decayed and began to disintegrate, the viceroy, Asaf Jah I  \\nproclaimed himself the Nizam and established independence rule of the Deccan. \\nHyderabad once again became a major capital city, ruled by successive Nizams of the  \\nAsaf Jahi dynasty until the state was merged into Indian Union in 1948. \\n \\nSECUNDERABAD: In 1798, a subsidiary alliance for military and political cooperation  \\nwas signed between the Nizam and the British East India company. There after an area  \\nnorth of what is now the Hussain Sagar was established as a cantonment. The area was  \\nnamed Secunderabad after the then Nizam, Sikander Jah. \\n \\nFrom nawabs and pearls to the world's hi-tech happening point, the city's journey \\nis fascinating. The sprawling metropolis is coming to terms with itself at the start of the  \\nnew millenium. The Qutb Shahi dynasty founded the Kingdom of Golconda, one of the  \\nfive kingdoms that emerged after the break up of the Bahamani Kingdom. The Qutb  \\nShahis ruled the Deccan for almost 171 years.All the seven rulers were patrons of \\nlearning and were great builders. They contributed to the grow th and development of  \\nIndo-Persian and Indo-Islamic literature and culture in Hyderabad. During the Qutb Shahi  \\nreign Golconda became one of the leading markets in the world of diamonds, pearls, steel  \\nfor arms, and also printed fabric. The glory of the Golconda kingdom ended in 1687, after \\na valiant struggle. Aurangzeb, the last great Mughal ruler, captured Golconda after a \\nsiege that lasted eight months. \\n \\nAbul Hasan Tana Shah, the last king of Golconda, was imprisoned at Daulatabad,  \\nwhere he died after twelve years in captivity. With the conquest of the Deccan and the  \\nSouth, Aurangzeb succeeded in expanding the Mughal Empire to cover the entire sub - \\ncontinent. However, after his death  in 1707, the Empire rapidly declined. At that time ,  \\nthe Deccan was ad ministered by a Subedar or viceroy of the Mughal Emperor. Mir  \\nQuamaruddin, the Governor of the Deccan, who bore the title of Nizam -ul-Mulk Feroze \\nJung Asif Jah, declared his independence from Mughal rule in 1724.He thus became the  \\nfirst Nizam and the found er of the Asif Jahi dynasty. Asif Jah I continued to maintain  \\nAruangabad, which had been founded by the Mughal  rulers as the  capital of  his new \\nstate. In 1769, Nizam Ali Khan Asif Jah II, shifted the capital to Hyderabad. The seven  \\nNizam's of the Asif Jahi  dynasty ruled the Deccan for nearly 224 years, right up to 1948.  \\nDuring the Asif Jahi period, Persian, Urdu, Telugu and Marathi developed \\nsimultaneously. The highest official positions were given to deserving persons \\nirrespective of their religion.\"),\n",

The rule of the seven  \\nNizam\\'s saw the growth of Hyderabad both culturally and economically.
